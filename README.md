## Description

This small webApp is a github API consumer that basically will get all the most starred github repos that were created in the last 30 days. and effectively this is a coding challenge for a Front-End Developer role.

## Features

- As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
- As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row.
- As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :
  - Repository name
  - Repository description
  - Number of stars for the repo.
  - Number of issues for the repo.
  - Username and avatar of the owner.
- As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).

## Choice of Technology

I have chosen to work with the Framework ReactJS as I'm more familiar with it than other front-end frameworks, an because of course of his virtual DOM which is one of the best development tools and its unrivaled ecosystem.
